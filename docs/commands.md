## Get torrents stats from InfluxDB

Command `stats-get` almost same as `torrent-list`, but it use InfluxDB:
```
transmission-cli stats-get [--name='name'] [--age='age'] [profit='>0'] [--days=7] [--sort=1] [--limit=10] [--rm]
```

You can also use `--name`, `--age`, `--sort`, `--limit`, plus `--profit` and `--days` options.

Profit = uploaded for period / torrent size. Profit metric more precise than uploaded ever value.

Show 10 worst torrents for last week:
```
transmission-cli stats-get --days 7 --profit '=0' --limit 10
```

Show stats of last added torrents sorted by profit:
```
transmission-cli stats-get --days 1 --age '<2' --sort='-7'
```


## Remove torrents

You can use command `stats-get` with `--rm` option to remove filtered unpopular torrents:
```
transmission-cli stats-get --days 7 --profit '=0' --rm
```

With `--rm` option you can use all options of `torrent-remove` command: `--soft`, `--dry-run`, `-y`.  

Without `-y` option command ask your confirmation for remove torrents.  

If you don't want to remove all filtered torrents, you can save ids of torrents and call `torrent-remove` manually.


## Send statistic to InfluxDB

Command should called every hour or more, possible every day, but it will less precise.

Command assume that all torrents have unique names.

You should to configure InfluxDB to use this functional.
